# Nvidia Nano Robot

Introduction
This project uses Nvidia Nano 4Gb board with an Arduino on a Omni wheel car. Undergraduate students can use this robot as a base for future development.

**Background**
This is a hand-on project for undergraduate students to integrate their software and hardware knowledge together on the robot.
The Nvidia board is mainly for machine learning and computer vision
The Arduino board is mainly for motor controls and sensors integration
Although Nvidia I/O can do most of the control and sensing, Arduino board is cheaper, and it is easy to debug or replace. And another advantage of Arduino Mega is that it runs in 5V, and has multiple interrupt pins and analog inputs.
